# ansible-role-pssid-GUI-install-configure
An Ansible role that installs and configures the pSSID GUI system to target.

## Requirements
Supported Linux versions:
* Ubuntu 20 (Focal)
* Ubuntu 22 (Jammy)

It requires Ansible v2.9 at least.

## Role Variables
`defaults/main.yml`:
* `pssid_gui_install_configure_install_path` is the install directory on a target
host that only contains a `docker-compose.yml` file, which Docker uses to
pull and run the Docker images of the GUI application. It defaults to
`/usr/lib/pssid`.

`vars/main.yml` (should not be changed for a regular install):
* `pssid_gui_root_dir` is set to `/var/lib/pssid`. It is the root directory for files
related to the application, not for its source code. It contains an `output/` folder
that contains the host and configuration files generated by the GUI, and a `plugins/`
folder that stores form templates for the Archivers and Tests pages.
* `pssid_gui_exec_dir` is set to `/usr/lib/exec/pssid`. It stores the `provision`
shell script.
